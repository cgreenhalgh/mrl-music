				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>Climb! is a new interactive work for piano by composer and
					pianist Maria Kallionpää.</p>
				<p>Climb! combines contemporary piano with elements of computer
					games to create a non-linear musical journal in which the pianist
					negotiates an ascent of a mountain, choosing their path as they go
					and encountering weather, animals and other obstacles along the way.</p>
				<p>Climb! employs the Mixed Reality Lab’s Muzicodes technology to
					embed musical triggers within the composition. Like hyperlinks,
					these may transport the player to another point in the score when
					successfully played, and may also trigger additional musical effects
					or control visuals. Climb! also uses a disklavier piano which
					physically plays alongside the human pianist during key passages,
					engaging them in a human-machine musical dialogue. The interactive
					score is delivered using The University of Oxford’s MELD dynamic
					annotated score renderer.</p>
				<p>The performance is part of the Nottingham Forum for Artistic
					Research (NottFAR) concert and events series. Climb! is supported by
					the EPSRC-funded FAST project (EP/L019981/1) and University of
					Nottingham’s Research Priority Area (RPA) Development Fund.</p>
